# Start an App Without Showing the Activity

The purpose of this plugin is to enable notifications, alarms, etc to
re-start your app and fire callbacks without the app causing any visual
cues to the user.

## Status

Currently works on Android only.

## Usage

There is no user-facing APIs for this plugin. Instead, it is meant to be
used from native code by other Cordova plugins. See `org.chromium.notifications`
and `org.chromium.alarms` for examples.
